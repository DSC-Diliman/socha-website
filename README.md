GDSC-UPD Solutions Challenge 2023 website ~~any% speedrun~~.

## Stack

This site uses [SvelteKit](https://kit.svelte.dev/).

Fortunately, we still get to use [Tailwind](https://tailwindcss.com/)! Make sure to include `lang=postcss` in all `style` tags that will use it, though.

We also use [`svelte-icons`](https://github.com/Introvertuous/svelte-icons) for our, well, icons. There's a catalogue [here](https://svelte-icons.vercel.app/).
